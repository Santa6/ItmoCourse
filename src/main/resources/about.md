# A simple Invoicer application built using Java EE and Vaadin

This application is built as an example application for Vaadin UI framework
and various Java EE technologies. Still it should be perfectly usable as such
in a real use.

To get it running, you'll need Google app key and OAuth settings for it.


The source code for this example is available 
[from github](https://github.com/mstahv/jpa-invoicer).
